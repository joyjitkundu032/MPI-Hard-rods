# Simulating a system on hard rods on a square lattice
This prog simulates a system of long rods with no intersection allowed in two dimensions on a square lattice in grand canonical ensemble. The chemical potential controls the density of the system. The rods are monodiepersed (of length k). It is a Monte Carlo(MC) simulation with heatbath dynamics where all the horizontal k-mers are evaporated and redeposited, then vertical k-mers and so on. The initial conditions can be of two kinds: (1) all empty and (2) half vertical half horizontal. This is controlled using INITIAL_FLAG. The mean density, order parameter, second and fourth moment along with the respective statistical error are measured. Horizontal rod is marked with 1 on lat while vertical rod is marked with 2.

The MC moves are nonlocal, thus it can equilibrate systems up to a very high density that was inaccessible before. The code has been parallelized using MPI.
